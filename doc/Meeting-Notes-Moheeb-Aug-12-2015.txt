Moheeb:
1. General problems in Mobile Unwanted Software.
exessive ads
unwanted modification
bundle install
privacy leak
impersonation

2. How to identify the original app / victim?
This is a research problemm.
Use heuristics + automated technique.
Are there good solutions for this?

3. Measure the incentives of impersonation and explain or provide detection.
Need samples of impersonating apps. 
3a. Collaboration. Share samples, join discussion and provide insights.
3b. Work as part-time researcher. Use Google's system and infrastructure to
detect.


Next steps:
1. talk with Wenke to see whether this is an interesting problem space
2. decide the scope of paper
3. talk with Monirul to see whether he is interested in exploring this space and
collaboration
4. what we can do, what we can share, what we can collaborate
