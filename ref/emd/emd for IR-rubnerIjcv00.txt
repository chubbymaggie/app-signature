1. what's the problem?
The Earth Mover Distance (EMD) is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to
transform one distribution into the other. Detail description is:

This paper combines this EMD with a representation scheme for distributions that
is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison
framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other
previously proposed methods. They focus on applications to color and texture,
and compared the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.

2. why should we care?
a. Naturally extends the notion of a distance between single elements to that of a 
distance between sets, or distributions, of elements
b. Can be applied to the more general variable-size signatures, which subsume
histograms. Signatures are more compact, and the cost of moving ``earth''
reflects the notion of nearness properly, without the quantization problems of
most other measures. 
c. Allows for partial matches in a very natural way. This is important, for
instance, for image retrieval and in order to deal with occlusions and clutter.
d. Is a true metric if the ground distance is metric and if the total weights of
two signatures are equal. This allows endowing image spaces with a metric
structure.
e. Is bounded from below by the distance between the centers of mass of the two
signatures when the ground distance is induced by a norm. Using this lower bound
in retrieval systems significantly reduced the number of EMD computations.
f. Matches perceptual similarity better than other measures, when the ground
distance is perceptually meaningful. This was shown by for color- and
texture-based image retrieval.

3. what's the key idea to solve this problem?
Represent each picture with a set of weighted features (color, texture), privide
definition for cost between signatures and compute the Earth Mover Distance
between two distributions (representation of two images).

4. how can we believe their solution?
Their feature representation makes sense. But from later papers, we can see
histograms seems to perform better than features given enough number of
histograms (this paper states that, large number of histograms is too slow).

5. anything surprising?
The L2-norm distance definition for color is tricky and makes sense.
d = sqrt( dl^2 + da^2 + db^2 + lambda(dx^2 + dy^2) )

6. what can we get from their approach?
a. The way to compute color features and texture features is interesting and
should be considered.
b. How to build relationship between EMD and Simhash need to be further looked
into, especially in case of color and texture.
c. Gradient information might be useful.
